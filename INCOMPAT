The use of Guile modules for individual components of scsh can cause
problems with macros that refer to unexported or imported bindings.
e.g., see the "run" comment in the USAGE file.

scsh features not implemented
=============================

char->char partial maps library (lib/ccp*)
flock interface (flock*)
Job control (jcontrol*)
NDBM interface (ndbm*)
ODBC interface (odbc/*)
pty interface (pty.scm)
tty interface (tty*)
Scheme 48 string ports.

Bugs in scsh fixed in guile-scsh
================================

delete-filesys-object can't delete directories in linux 2.4.

receive-message! usually returns only the number of bytes instead of
the two values documented in the scsh-manual: the number of bytes and
the remote address.  It does return the two values when EOF is seen.

receive-message usually fails since it tries to receive multiple
values from "receive-message!"  See above.

filter-weak-ptr-list in procobj.scm seems to have a typo in its last
line: list instead of lis.  This was causing problems for guile-scsh but
doesn't seem to matter in scsh.  Hmm.

network-info doesn't work if its argument is a socket address.

Other incompatibilities with scsh
=================================

The Guile module system is not compatible with the Scheme48 system
used in scsh.

Sockets are created unbuffered in Guile, but buffered in scsh.

with-enabled-interrupts disables all interrupts in guile-scsh.

Guile I/O procedures haven't been changed throughout to accept file
descriptors in place of ports, e.g., display, write, read-char.

The close-on-exec flag is not set on unrevealed ports.
