guile-scsh is an incomplete port of the Scheme Shell to Guile.
guile-scsh 2.x is based on scsh 0.5.3 and is compatible with
the Guile 1.6.x series.  It will not work with Guile 1.4.x.

For the original scsh package and documentation, see:

http://www.scsh.net/
http://sourceforge.net/projects/scsh/

The original scsh package has a detailed manual:
scsh-0.5.3/doc/scsh-manual.ps

guile-scsh 2.x requires the guilerxspencer module, available from
http://arglist.com/guile/.  A few guile-scsh modules can still be used
if it's not installed.  It's possible to install guile-scsh first and
guilerxspencer later.

Please send bug reports to:

bug-guile@gnu.org

To install guile-scsh, use something like:

./configure --prefix=<see below>
make install

The prefix given to configure should probably match the prefix where
Guile's site directory can be found.  Otherwise Guile won't find the
module without further configuration.  E.g.,

--prefix=/usr --> /usr/share/guile/site
--prefix=/usr/local --> /usr/local/share/guile/site

Alternatively it's sufficient to rename (or link) the main guile-scsh
directory to "scsh" and place it somewhere in the Guile load path (type
%load-path in an interactive Guile session to see the current
setting).

For more information see:

INSTALL for generic configure documentation.

USAGE for notes on using the library with Guile.

INCOMPAT for differences with the original scsh.
